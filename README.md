# Peah
Peah (“Corner”) is the second tractate in Seder Zeraim (“Order of Seeds”) and the first in the order to explicitly address the order’s main topic, agricultural commandments. The tractate’s first four chapters discuss the mitzvah of peah, or leaving crops in the corner of a field for the poor to take, based in Leviticus 19:9 and 23:22.
